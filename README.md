Batchsize refers to the size of the data subsets that the model will see on each iteration of training. Common batch sizes tend to be in the range 32-512. Because we have 100 training example, I changed the batchsize from 32 to 50.
The higher the batch size, the more memory space you'll need.
More accurate the estimate of the gradient will be.
